"Monsters, explosions, senseless destruction. You've seen the movies, you know what to do."

_battalion_ was a game written in 1994 on my Silicon Graphics Indy in GL
for the IndiZone 3 contest as a way for me to unwind after completing my
PhD. This version also ran in the CAVE(tm) as a virtual reality game and
was first publically shown at the EVE 4 art show in May 1995. The GL
version won 'best indy software' at IndiZone 3 and was made available on
the Indizone3 CDROM.

I converted battalion to OpenGL (with several enhancements) and modified
it to work with the MESA graphics library in late 1996. In 1997 it won
the Hot Mix 17 game contest from SGI, and was available on the Hot Mix
17 CDROM. In 1999 I upgraded the CAVE version to OpenGL so it would run
on SGI, Linux, and HP powered CAVES and ImmersaDesks.

The desktop version was ported to a variety of platforms by myself and
others: Suns under SunOS 4 and Solaris 2, under Linux, on HP
workstations, under AIX, under OpenVMS, on the Macintosh, on Windows 95
and the BeOS. My latest enhancements to the desktop versions were the
classic and carbon macintosh versions, and a Windows 95/NT/98/xp
version.

After a few years hiatus I have come back to my original code and
decided to port it to the iPhone ... which has about the equivalent
OpenGL graphics power to my SGI indy from 1995.

Here are the various versions of battalion that you can download.

[WARNING]
====
Many of these were compiled several years ago so I'm not sure what will
happen if you try to run them, or even if they will still run. As of
2009 the only currently supported version of the game is on the iPhone
and iPad, though I fixed the linux version in the summer of 2010 so that
should still run.

Googelon. Flutter, Techs, the Vapour, and I disclaim any bad things that
may happen to you, your loved ones, your co-workers, your pets, your
social life, or your electronic equipment as the result of downloading
and playing this game ... so if you go on a shooting rampage at a
fast-food restaurant please don't blame me.

For many years I have wanted to make a strategy game where you would play the army and deploy forces and allocate resources to combat the attacking giant monsters.
When the indizone contest came along it was obvious that such a game was not appropriate but that an arcade version of the concept would work.

A major inspiration for the look of the game came while I was watching
my Japanese laserdisc of 'Radon' (This version lacks the unending
naration of the American version, and all of the people in Japan do not
sound like either George Takei or Keye Luke.) While watching the battle
between the Radons and the army in Sasebo I started making some drawings
and that led to the game.

The idea of playing the army quickly faded as it would have been
extremely difficult to control all of the various units involved, so the
player was soon playing the monster. And after all, you always did want
to be the monster when you were a kid. When I decided to make the game
look like the kind of battle children would have with plastic monsters
on a model railroad the style of the game all fell into place. I also
wanted to make the kind of game that Calvin (from Calvin and Hobbes)
would love to play ... though he would probably also want to be able to
crush the fleeing citizens.

The one other requirement for the game was that I wanted to have what I
dubbed the 'MechaGodzilla firestorm' from the two 1970's MechaGodzilla
movies, where there were pyrotechnics and coloured rays shooting all
over the place. MechaGoogelon originally was to play that role, but I
thought adding a hero (a non-denominational Ultraman, UltraSeven,
Mirror-Man, pick your favorite) was better suited that purpose ... and
its just fun to fight the hero.

Aside from the obvious movie and TV influences, _battalion_ was influenced by two of my favorite old apple ][ games: Jon Freeman's 'Crush, Crumble, and Chomp: the Movie Monster Game' and Mark Allen's 'Sabotage!'

CC&C was a strategy game where you played a movie monster in a major
city, eating people, fighting the national guard, trying to avoid
stepping on power plants, and keeping a sharp eye out for the mad
scientist in his helicopter.

Sabotage was the original(?) 'lone gun emplacement beseiged by
paratroopers' game which has since been reincarnated many times on many
different platforms.

I want to thank the members of the Electronic Visualization Lab for all
their helpful suggestions during the development of this game (though
almost all of the suggestions were 'give us more stuff to blow up').

I also want to thank Ray Harreyhausen, Eiji Tsubaraya, and all the
others who perform magic with pieces of rubber and plastic.
